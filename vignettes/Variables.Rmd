Forth-like languages are nice because they don't require a lot of variables. However, sometimes there's a problem that requires saving a particular value for later usage that can't be on the stack. This is where variables, constants, and arrays come in.

## Variables

Let's say we want to store a value somewhere outside of the stack. We can initialize a variable using the `VARIABLE` word.
```
fr> VARIABLE testvar
ok.
```
Nothing happened! That's because this word only allocates space for a variable without doing any other actions. We can now call the name of the variable at any time to push its address onto the stack. In Forth, this would be an actual memory address. `froth`, however, uses an abstracted memory map.
```
fr> test .s
[[1]]
[1] "addr <test, cell 0>"

[[2]]
NULL

ok.
```
We can see the address of the variable at the top of the stack. We'll come back to the `cell 0` bit later.

To store a value in a variable, we use `!`. We can copy the value in an address to the stick using `@`.
```
fr> variable newvar
ok.
fr> 20 newvar !
ok.
fr> newvar @ .
20 ok.
```
Notice that for `!` we push the value first, then the address. It's also important to note that the variable retains its value even after calling `@`. 
```
fr> variable newvar
ok.
fr> 20 newvar !
ok.
fr> newvar dup @ . dup @ . @ .
20 20 20 ok.
```

`@ .` is a pretty common call to inspect the value of a variable. In fact, it's so common that there's a shortcut word to perform both, `?`.

```
fr> variable newvar 20 newvar !
ok.
fr> newvar ?
20 ok.
```

Variables are often useful as counters, using the `+!` command. `+!` is similar to `!`, except that it adds to the variable rather than replacing it.
```
fr> variable newvar 
ok.
fr> 0 newvar !
ok.
fr> 5 0 do 1 newvar +! loop newvar ?
5 ok.
```

## Constants

Sometimes we just need a name for a value. Variables that will never change values are called constants, and can be fittingly be defined with the `CONSTANT` word.

```
fr> 100 CONSTANT hundred
ok.
fr> hundred .
100 ok.
```

Constants avoid the hassle of dealing with addresses, and can be accessed slightly faster than variables. Calling the name of the variable copies its value directly onto the stack.

## Arrays

Remember when I said we'd come back to that whole "`cell 0`" thing? By default, initializing a variable creates space for one "thing" at an address. Unlike Forth, `froth` creates this space at an abstracted memory location, and that space is big enough for any arbitrary R object. However, sometimes it's nice to have a variable that can store more than one value, like in the case of vectors or lists in R.

Let's start by initializing an array. The definition proceeds like in normal variables, we just have to further specify that we want the variable to be larger than a single value:

```
fr> VARIABLE myarray 5 CELLS ALLOT
ok.
```
This initializes a variable with 5 slots for things. Internally, this is the same as a length 5 list. The word `ALLOT` allots memory for the preceding variable, and we'll come back to `CELLS` in a moment.

Previously, we saw this behavior:
```
fr> myarray .s
[[1]]
[1] "addr <myarray, cell 0>"

[[2]]
NULL

ok.
```

`cell 0` means that this address is pointing to the first value of the array `myarray`. Cells are 0-indexed in `froth`, so this is the first entry in the array. Now as before, we can store a value at the first cell. I'm assuming the address is still on the stack, so remember we need to call `swap` to ensure the top value is the address.

```
fr> 1 swap !
ok.
fr> myarray ?
1 ok.
```

Ok, now we can look at the word `CELLS`. Let's start by inspecting what we get by pushing `CELLS` to the stack:
```
fr> 4 CELLS .s clear
[[1]]
[1] "addr <, cell 4>"

[[2]]
NULL

ok.
```

It's the fourth cell of...nothing? `CELLS` creates a unique kind of address--it stores cell number, but it doesn't point to any variable. Words like `ALLOT` expect one of these objects to tell it how much space to allocate. While `CELLS` calls don't point to anything, we can add them to variable addresses to get to other values in the array.

```
fr> myarray
ok.
fr> 4 CELLS + .s
[[1]]
[1] "addr <myarray, cell 4>"

[[2]]
NULL

ok.
```
Notice how we've now gotten an address to `myarray` that's offset by 4 cells. Since the size of `myarray` is 5, this is the final entry in the array (indexing starts at 0, so the 5 entries are 0-4). This address works like the examples in the Variables section, so we can use `!`, `@`, `+!`, and `?` on it:

```
fr> VARIABLE myarray 5 CELLS ALLOT
ok.
fr> 0 BEGIN dup 5 < WHILE dup dup myarray swap CELLS + ! 1 + REPEAT drop
ok.
```
Here we're putting it all together. See if you can guess what the contents of `myarray` now look like before reading the next section.

We start by initializing an array `myarray` of size 5. Then, we put `0` on the stack and `begin` a loop. At each iteration of the loop we:
1. Dup the top of the stack and check if less than 5; if not, go to (8)
2. Dup the top of the stack twice.
3. Load the address of `myarray`, swap it with the top duplicate
4. Create a cell offset equal to the top duplicate, add to the address of `myarray`
5. Store the second duplicate (from 2) at the offset location
6. Add 1 to the value on the stack
7. loop
8. finish loop

So what happens? When the stack is 0, we store 0 at the 0th position of `myarray`, then 1 at the 1st position, 2 at the second, etc. Let's print out the entire array:
```
fr> 5 0 do myarray i cells + ? loop
0 1 2 3 4 ok.
```

It's also possible to initialize an array to a specific value using the `CREATE` and `,` words. *Pay very close attention to this syntax!*
```
fr> CREATE myarray 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,
ok.
fr> 5 0 do myarray i cells + ? loop
0 1 2 3 4 ok.
```

Did you notice how we used `,`? Unlike English, `,` is a `froth` word, meaning that it needs to be space separated and it acts upon the stack. This means that we **must** include a command after the last element to ensure it's added to the array.

## Modifying Arrays

It's often useful to be able to quickly change the values or the size of allocated arrays.

To change the values in an array, we can use the `FILL` word. `FILL` expects three items on the stack: a variable address, a `CELLS` offset `n`, and a value `x`. It then fills the first `n` cells with `x`.

```
fr> variable filltest 3 cells allot
ok.
fr> 3 0 do i filltest i cells + ! loop
ok.
fr> 3 0 do filltest i cells + ? loop
0 1 2 ok.
fr> filltest 3 cells 10 fill
ok.
fr> 3 0 do filltest i cells + ? loop
10 10 10 ok.
```
There's also the shortcut word `ERASE`, which is equivalent to `0 FILL`.
```
fr> filltest 3 cells erase
ok.
fr> 3 0 do filltest i cells + ? loop
0 0 0 ok.
```

That changes values, but what if we end up with the wrong size array altogether? For that, we have two options: `EXTEND` and `REALLOT`. Both of these words have the same form; they expect the stack to be comprised of a variable address `v` and a value `n`. `EXTEND` will make the array at `v` larger by `n` cells, and `REALLOT` will change `v` to have exactly `n` cells (copying the contents of the first `n` cells, if any).

```
fr> variable myarray 3 cells allot
ok.
fr> myarray 5 cells + ?
Error: array accessed out of bounds!
fr> myarray 2 cells extend
ok.
fr> myarray 5 cells + ?
0 ok.
fr> 10 myarray 1 cells + !
ok.
fr> myarray 3 cells reallot
ok.
fr> myarray 5 cells + ?
Error: array accessed out of bounds!
fr> myarray 1 cells + ?
10 ok.
```

If you're ever unsure about how large your array is, use the `LENGTH` word to copy the length of an address to the stack, and `LENGTH?` to print it out.

```
fr> variable myarray 10 cells allot
ok.
fr> myarray LENGTH .
10 ok.
fr> myarray 20 cells reallot
ok.
fr> myarray LENGTH?
20 ok.
```
