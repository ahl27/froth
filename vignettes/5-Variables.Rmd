# Variables, Constants, and Arrays

Forth-like languages are nice because they don't require a lot of variables. However, sometimes there's a problem that requires saving a particular value for later usage that can't be on the stack. This is where variables, constants, and arrays come in.

## Variables

## Constants

## Arrays

## Words in this chapter
- `VARIABLE xxx`: creates a variable named `xxx`
- `! ( n addr -- )`: stores the value `n` at address `addr`
- `@ ( addr -- n )`: copies the value at `addr` to the stack
- `? ( addr -- )`: prints the value of `addr`
- `+! ( n addr -- )`: adds the value `n` to the value at `addr`
- `CONSTANT xxx (n -- )`: creates a constant called `xxx` that stores `n`; `xxx` returns `n` when called
- `ALLOT ( addr ncells -- )`: allocates `ncells` cells at `addr`
- `CELLS ( n -- )`: creates a memory address offset for arrays
- `FILL ( addr n val -- )`: fills `n` cells of memory beginning at `addr` with `val`
- `ERASE ( addr n -- )`: fills `n` cells of memory beginning at `addr` with 0
