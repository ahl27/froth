# Introduction

Forth is a pretty darn cool language. Despite being older than C, Forth is a high level, typeless, stack-oriented programming language that doubles as an extremely lighweight operating system. Think BASIC, but...cooler.

The beauty of Forth is its simplicity. The system is comprised of a single data stack and a dictionary, essentially a linked list containing definitions called "words". Each word links to executable code. When a user enters text, the interpreter traverses the dictionary for each entered word and executes the corresponding code. Forth's stack-oriented design means usage of variables is limited. 

`froth` brings a Forth-like system to R. You can drop into a command-line editor, or call Forth operations from R. Since `froth` runs on top of R, it supports all of R's data structures. `froth` is not as fast as modern implementations of Forth, but this package is more intended as a fun way to play with Forth-style syntax than as a replacement for existing Forths. However, stack-oriented algorthms do have their advantages, and you may find that your R code could benefit from `froth`!

The included vignettes detail a crash course on `froth`-style Forth, using the excellent guide on forth.com as a template.
