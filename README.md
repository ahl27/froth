# froth: FORTH for R

<img src="./froth.png" width="400" class="center"/>

froth is a FORTH implementation for R (or at least, it will be).

I've just started development, but this README will be updated as I get further in this project.
So far I'm maybe 1/3rd of the way to a working first version. This will (likely) not be a 1:1 copy
of Gforth, I think I'd rather have a forth implementation that is robust and works in R than one
that exacly imitates existing Gforth. But...tbd.

## Implemented Words
- Arithmetic
- Unary operations
- Logical Comparators
- if / then statements

## TODOs
- loops
- user-defined macros
- other stuff?
